# MarioMind-Reinforcement-Learning-Adventure

## Overview
This project explores the application of reinforcement learning in navigating the classic game **Super Mario Bros**. By training an agent using advanced techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the agent learns to tackle challenges and master levels in this enchanting world.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenAI Gym (`gym_super_mario_bros`)
- TensorFlow
- StableBaseLine3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizing progress)

## Results

Once trained, the agent should be able to navigate and complete levels of Super Mario Bros. The notebook includes visualizations of the training process and rewards obtained.

## Key Takeaways

- Implemented a reinforcement learning agent to play Super Mario Bros using the `gym_super_mario_bros` environment.
- Trained the agent using trial-and-error to learn optimal actions for navigating the game.
- Utilized reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous improvement of the agent's performance.
- Demonstrated the agent's learning progress with visualizations and results.

This project showcases the potential of reinforcement learning for solving complex control tasks in a simulated environment.
